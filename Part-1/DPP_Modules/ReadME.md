# Digital Product Passport Ontology Modules

The **Digital Product Passport (DPP) Ontology Modules** are a comprehensive set of resources designed to facilitate the standardized integration and management of product data across various domains. These modules play a crucial role in ensuring traceability, compliance, and sustainability within the digital product ecosystem.

## Further Reading

For an in-depth understanding of the concepts and research underpinning these modules, please refer to the following documents:

- **Journal Paper:** [A modular ontology modeling approach to developing digital product passports to promote circular economy in the built environment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2024.05.007)
- **Thesis:** [Ontology and Knowledge Graph-Based Product Data Representation for Sustainable Buildings](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:hj:diva-65950)

These documents provide detailed insights into the development and application of the DPP Ontology.

## Continuous Improvement

⚠️**These modules are NOT COMPLETE YET. The work is still IN PROGRESS** and continually refined based on user feedback, emerging industry standards, and the evolving needs of the digital product landscape. Our goal is to maintain their relevance and utility, ensuring they serve as robust tools for the management and sustainability of product information.

Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.
